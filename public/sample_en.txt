This is a quick English sample to test RSVP reading speed.

Today I decided to focus. Not multitask. Not scroll. Just read.

Short words matter: and, or, but, so, to, of, in.
Long words matter too: incomprehensibility, personalization, synchronization, interoperability.

Numbers and symbols: 3.14, 2026, 1/2, 87%, + - / * = @ #.

Punctuation matters. Periods say “stop.” Commas say “breathe.” Questions ask: do you understand?

If the red focus letter stays in the same place, your eyes can stay still and your brain can go fast.
